                        <h1>Javascript Project</h1>
                        <h3>Craps</h3>
                        <p>This was what I had orginally chosen for my Javascript Project and ended up working on it for a few hours before realizing I was supposed to be using forms to do the project. At the same point I figured I might as well share some of the updates and struggles I had along the way.</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Update 1: Trying to get the dice to be the correct size on the screen and have the numbers centered messing with divs and margins to make it look how I planned</li>
                            <li>Update 2: Figuring out a color scheme that reminds me of casino games</li>
                            <li>Update 3: By using an active pseudo selector and the transform property to scale the button .95 to give it a nice pressing animation </li>
                            <li>Update 4: Somethings gotta break at some point right? Button is only working for the first roll for some reason</li>
                            <li>Update 5: I was able to get it to work by declaring the variables outside of the addEventListener.</li>
                            <li>Update 6: Having an issue where the total is concatenating rather than performing additon, I know this is due to it interpreting the two ints as strings as javascript is weakly typed.</li>
                            <li>Update 7: Fixed issue by creating seperate varibales to store the random numbers and add them together before changing the totals inner text.</li>
                            <li>Update 8: After debating about how I would display win or lose I decided on trying to have it display YOU WIN or YOU LOSE with one work in each die. I think this looks really clean.</li>
                            <li>Update 9: Decided to go overview the requirements for the final I noticed it said that we would be using forms on our javascript project which is unfortunate as I did not use any thus far</li>
                            <li>Final Update: Welp I didn't finishe the logic for this and don't want to waste any time so gonna take a break and do a different project.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <h3><a href="https://alwayscoding13.github.io/PizzaWithPizzazz/">Pizza With Pizzazz</a></h3>
                        <p>After a little break I decided to change routes and go with the pizza pos system as I figued if I was going to rework my code I might as well just do something different anyway. Drew up a little design and am getting started programming now.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Update 1: Thought a pizza website would look cool with a brick wall background, first time working with background images.</li>
                            <li>Update 2: Ran into an issue where the background is clipping/repeating and in turn doesn't look the cleanest, to w3schools we go to find the solution!</li>
                            <li>Update 3: Discovered the background-size property that can take the value "cover" this solved my issue and I think looks pretty nice.</li>
                            <li>Update 4: Labels not properly aligning messing with the divs and margins to place things where I orignally inteded</li>
                            <li>Update 5: Having trouble connecting the script looking back at past project to see what i'm missing</li>
                            <li>Update 6: "Reciept" not displaying researching how to change text of P tag with javascript</li>
                            <li>Update 7: I was trying to get the inner Text of a radio button for awhile before realizing.. there is no inner text the text is displayed with the label!</li>
                            <li>Update 8: Added a value to each radio button and displaying the value on the reciept.</li>
                            <li>Update 9: Added a white background and black border to simulate a recipt. Pretty happy with the final result.</li>
                        </ul>
