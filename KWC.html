                        <h3>KWC Trick Selector</h3>
                        <p>I consider myself to be a kendama enthusiast and based on it being a wooden toy there isn't much technology implemented in the hobby. Every year they host a Kendama World Championship(KWC) with 12 trick difficulty levels with 10 different tricks per level.
                        My project idea is to build an app that will let you select a level and tap a button to select a random trick to land. Some more features I'm thinking of adding are the ability to select multiple levels if you wanted more variety in the random seletion. 
                        I also want to implement some sort of a consistency tracker to log how many times you were successful in landing a trick. KWC also provides video examples of each trick as well so another feature would be the option to click the trick name to go to the video example. Currently I have 0 experience with mobile application development but am excited to dive into the topic and look forward to providing updates on the journey.

                        <p>After doing some research i've decided to use <b>.Net Xamarin</b> to try and build this application because I have familiarity with <b>C#</b> and using the Visual Studio IDE. I'm also going to have to spend some time learning <b>XAML</b> so I can properly style and format the application. Microsoft has some tutorials live on their <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/x'amarin">Dotnet website</a> so i'm planning on starting there to get a basic understanding of <b>Xamarin</b> before beginning development on this project.</p><br>
                        <p><b>Update 1:</b> I was a little over expecting of my current skill-set and with my work schedule this project has been put on hold.</p><br>
                        <p><b>Update 2:</b> Xamarin had a great starting layout with the flyout option trying to see how to get it looking close to what I want.</p><br>
                        <p><b>Update 3:</b>Figured out how to update the image and colors in layout xaml has been a challange to understand how it connects to C#</p>
