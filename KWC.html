        <h1 style=color:white>KWC Trick Selector App</h1>
        <p style=color:white>After doing some research i've decided to use <b>.Net Xamarin</b> to try and build this application because I have familiarity with <b>C#</b> and using the Visual Studio IDE. I'm also going to have to spend some time learning <b>XAML</b> so I can properly style and format the application. Microsoft has some tutorials live on their <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/xamarin">Dotnet website</a> so i'm planning on starting there to get a basic understanding of <b>Xamarin</b> before beginning development on this project.</p>
