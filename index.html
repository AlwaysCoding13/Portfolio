                        <h3>KWC Trick Selector</h3>
                        <p>I consider myself to be a kendama enthusiast and based on it being a wooden toy there isn't much technology implemented in the hobby. Every year they host a Kendama World Championship(KWC) with 12 trick difficulty levels with 10 different tricks per level.
                        My project idea is to build an app that will let you select a level and tap a button to select a random trick to land. Some more features I'm thinking of adding are the ability to select multiple levels if you wanted more variety in the random seletion. 
                        I also want to implement some sort of a consistency tracker to log how many times you were successful in landing a trick. KWC also provides video examples of each trick as well so another feature would be the option to click the trick name to go to the video example. Currently I have 0 experience with mobile application development but am excited to dive into the topic and look forward to providing updates on the journey.

                    <h3>Javascript Project</h3>
                    <p>Got an asignment to make a javascript project in my front end web dev course with three options to choose from. Craps, a Pizza Pos or a content management system. 
                        I had orginally decided to go ahead with the craps game as I was familar with the dice game already ended up spending a few hours working on it before realizing I was supossed to be using forms. At that point I decided to pivot to doing the pizza pos system.
