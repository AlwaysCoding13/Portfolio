        <h3 style=color:white>KWC Trick Selector</h3>
        <p style=color:white>I consider myself to be a kendama enthusiast and based on it being a wooden toy there isn't much technology implemented in the hobby. Every year they host a Kendama World Championship(KWC) with 12 trick difficulty levels with 10 different tricks per level.
           My project idea is to build an app that will let you select a level and tap a button to select a random trick to land. Some more features I'm thinking of adding are the ability to select multiple levels if you wanted more variety in the random seletion. 
           I also want to implement some sort of a consistency tracker to log how many times you were successful in landing a trick. KWC also provides video examples of each trick as well so another feature would be the option to click the trick name to go to the video example. Currently I have 0 experience with mobile application development but am excited to dive into the topic and look forward to providing updates on the journey.
